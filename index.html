  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="overview">
    <p>Since ChatGPT was released, it has become inevitable to revolutionize research and clinical practices. However, it also brings challenges and concerns such as factual correctness, ethical consideration, and systematic biases. This special panel aims to engage in an urgent and wide-ranging debate about the capability and risks of ChatGPT and Large Language Models and the development and responsible use of this technology for research and healthcare decision-making.</p>
